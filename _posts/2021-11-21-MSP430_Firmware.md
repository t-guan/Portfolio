As part of one of my university courses, I complted various excerises by writing firmware to a TI MSP430 chip. The chip's datasheets were used to understand the behaviour of the chip and how it could be coded.<br/><br/>
The chip was programmed in C, using Code Composer Studio. A variety of functions were coded, which includes using parts internal to the chip, using it to communicate via UART to a computer, and using the computer to control the chip itself.

The UI on the computer side was written in C#, using Windows Forms. Generally, these forms were used to check what data was being reported from the device and act upon it. Eventually, the same board was used on the two-axis gantry system and firmware was written to control the motor system.

A few demos of the device perfoming different tasks can be found.
