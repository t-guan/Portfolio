Technology in the beekeeping industry has not had any major advancements in the past 150 years. 
We believe that technological advancements will not only improve colony health, but also combat the overall decline of beekeeping as a practice. 
We aim to solve certain issues revolving around beekeeping, with our implementation of an smart beehive aimed at urban beekeeping, which has seen growth in the last decade. 
Urban beekeeping allows non-professionals to beekeep effectively without needing the resources of a dedicated apiary. 
We feel that our contribution through this project, if further refied, could be impactful to this industry as a whole, as we can provide a health benefit to the bees and improve the efficiency of existing beekeeping practices.<br/><br/>
This is just the first in an ongoing project, where the hive is going to be further designed to be a far more refined product. This first iteration was mainly to test the control and instrumentation of a few key features, and will hopefully start developing varroa detection and
countermeaures in the new year.
